# Web Hosting
We have used Google Icloud because Google Cloud Platform offers services for compute, storage, networking, big data, machine learning and the internet of things (IoT), as well as cloud management, security and developer tools. It is payable but we are using free trial for 3 months. With benefit:
- It is very fast which increases performance of executing the project.
- It offers live migration of applications.
- GCP provides innovative solutions in Big data, AI and machine learning in comparison to other competitors.
- It offers many benefits such as high productivity, work from anywhere, quick collaboration, high security, fewer data stored on vulnerable devices, reliable resources to be used by geographically distributed organizations.
