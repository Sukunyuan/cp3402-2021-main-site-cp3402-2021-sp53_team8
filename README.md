We are the eighth group of CP3402. Our website is to serve the local people, allowing them to book and buy fruits online. We interviewed the local people's preferences. The overall design of our website is a simple style, so that customers can clearly understand Information about our fruit shops and the products they want to buy. The overall layout of our website is in the center of the page, and we will change the overall color distribution according to the season, because our fruit is related to the season, and the fruit in the season is fresh and delicious.
